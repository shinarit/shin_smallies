This document describes the protocol with which the remote AI ("AI") and the controller communicates.

Every message is a line, with \n at the end.

Every turn begins with controller -> AI "BEGIN" and ends with AI -> controller "END".
Communication is always happens by one line alternating query/command and reply/ack.

AI -> controller
commands:
  get speed
  get coords
  get team
  get enemies
  get friends

  speed x y   #sets the speed vector, will be limited with max speed if larger, x and y are floating point numbers
  shoot x y   #x and y are floating point numbers

  end

controller -> AI
  speed x y   #x and y are floating point numbers
  coords x y  #x and y are floating point numbers
  team n      #n is int, 0 means everyone is enemy
  enemies [team x y]*
  friends [x y]*

  ack

  begin
