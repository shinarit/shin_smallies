This document describes the protocol with which the remote AI ("AI") and the controller communicates.

Every message is a line, with \n at the end.

Every turn begins with controller -> AI "BEGIN" and ends with AI -> controller "END".
Communication is always happens by one line alternating query/command and reply/ack.

AI -> controller
commands:
  get speed
  get coords
  get team
  get enemies
  get friends
  get bullets
  get context

  speed x y                       #sets the speed vector, will be limited with max speed if larger, x and y are floating point numbers
  shoot x y                       #x and y are floating point numbers

  end

controller -> AI
  speed x y                               #x and y are floating point numbers
  coords x y                              #x and y are floating point numbers
  team n                                  #n is int, 0 means everyone is enemy
  enemies [team x y]*                     #team is int, x and y are floating point numbers
  friends [x y]*                          #x and y are floating point numbers
  bullets [team fx fy bx by]*             #team is int, fx, fy, bx and by are floating point numbers, giving the Front and Backof the bullet
  context sizex sizey shipsize shipspeed\ #sizex and sizey are int, giving the size of the playground, shipsize gives the radius of the ships, shipspeed gives the maximum velocity
          bullets cooldown laserlen \     #bullets give the maximum number of bullets shot before cooldown, cooldown is the recharge period required to bullets, laserlen is the length of the bullet
          laserspeed deadtime             #laserspeed is the speed the lasers travel each round, deadtime is the rounds spent dead when hit

  ack
  dead

  begin
