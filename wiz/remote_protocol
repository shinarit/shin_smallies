This document describes the protocol with which the remote AI ("AI") and the controller communicates.

Every message is a line, with \n at the end.

Every turn begins with controller -> AI "BEGIN" and ends with AI -> controller "END".
Communication is always happens by one line alternating query/command and reply/ack.

AI -> controller
commands:
  speed x y   #sets the speed vector, will be limited with max speed if larger, x and y are integers
  shoot x y   #x and y are integers
  END

controller -> AI
  ack
  BEGIN
